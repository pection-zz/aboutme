  # Adjustments represent a change to the +item_total+ of an Order. Each
  # adjustment has an +amount+ that can be either positive or negative.
  #
  # Adjustments can be "opened" or "closed". Once an adjustment is closed, it
  # will not be automatically updated.
  #
  # == Boolean attributes
  #
  # 1. *eligible?*
  #
  #    This boolean attributes stores whether this adjustment is currently
  #    eligible for its order. Only eligible adjustments count towards the
  #    order's adjustment total. This allows an adjustment to be preserved if
  #    it becomes ineligible so it might be reinstated.
