# Display order

You can display your products in a specific order on product listings
pages for each of your store's [taxons][taxonomies].

To start assigning a display order for your products, go to the **Products ->
Display Order** page.

<!-- TODO: Add screenshot of the display order interface. -->

First, choose the taxon that you want to sort products for. Then, you can drag
the available products into new positions in the list.
