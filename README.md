# Robotic Engineering Projects #

## [Lens Quality Checking using Machine Learning](https://github.com/pection/aboutme/tree/master/Lendetection-FinalProject) ##
* Published by Bachelor of Engineering Program in Robotics Engineeing
* This research project is about checking the quality of the lens with machine learning methods and Machine VISION
* The result of experiments show that the lens quality checking using machine learning can be achieved a performance testing with 99
* This method can be applied to check the quality of lens in manufacturing automation in the future
Keywords : checking the quality of the lens / polarization / image processing / machine learning
